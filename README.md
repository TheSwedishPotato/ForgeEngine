# Forge Engine - Medieval Life Simulation

## Overview
Forge Engine is an advanced medieval life simulation system that models complex social, economic, and environmental interactions in a historically accurate setting. The engine uses cutting-edge AI and machine learning techniques to create emergent behaviors and narratives.

## Features

### Core Systems
- Multi-threaded simulation engine
- Advanced memory management with object pooling
- Comprehensive profiling and logging
- Save/load functionality

### AI and Behavior
- Personality-driven NPC behavior
- Emotional response system
- Machine learning for decision making
- Adaptive storytelling

### Historical Simulation
- Era-specific social norms
- Complex economic systems
- Professional progression
- Cultural constraints

### Environmental Systems
- Dynamic climate simulation
- Seasonal changes
- Natural disasters
- Resource management

### Multi-Village Mechanics
- Inter-village trade
- Diplomatic relations
- Technology diffusion
- Cultural exchange

### Visualization
- SFML-based rendering
- Interactive UI
- Camera controls
- Minimap system
